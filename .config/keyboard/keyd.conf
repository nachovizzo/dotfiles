# Advanced use of capslock as a triple function key:
#
# - when 'capslock' is tapped (pressed + released), it behaves as ESC key
# - when 'capslock' is held, and used in combination with another key, it behaves like a 'super_L'
# - when 'capslock' is heldwe enter a 3rd state for "VIM mode" where hjkl keys become arrow keys
#   until capslock is released.
